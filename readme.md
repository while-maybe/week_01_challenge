# Challenge: Build Your Personal Portfolio Web Page

## Objective:

In this challenge, you will apply the skills you’ve learned—HTML, CSS, display modes, forms, styling fonts, colors, selectors, and semantic HTML—to build and style a personal portfolio webpage from scratch. The page will showcase your contact details, a picture of yourself, and at least two images representing projects you’ve worked on. Additionally, you will deploy your page using **GitHub Pages**.

---

## Challenge Requirements:

### 1. HTML Structure and Semantic Elements:

- Use semantic HTML to structure your webpage (e.g., `<header>`, `<main>`, `<section>`, `<footer>`, `<article>`).
- Create the following sections:
  - **Header**: Include your name and a navigation bar (e.g., "About", "Projects", "Contact").
  - **About Section**: Add a picture of yourself and a short bio.
  - **Projects Section**: Showcase at least **two images** of imaginary projects you’ve worked on, with a brief description of each.
  - **Contact Section**: Include your contact details in a form format (name, email, message).
  - **Footer**: Add copyright information or any relevant details.

### 2. CSS Styling:

- Link an external **CSS file** and use it to style the webpage.
- Style the following:
  - **Fonts**: Choose a suitable font for your webpage and apply it using `font-family`. Include font styling like `font-size`, `font-weight`, etc.
  - **Colors**: Define background colors, text colors, and hover effects using color values (hex, RGB, or named colors).
  - **Selectors**: Use **class** and **ID** selectors to style different parts of the page, along with element and universal selectors where necessary.
  - **Display Modes**: Use appropriate display modes (`block`, `inline`, `inline-block`, and `none`) to arrange the elements on your page, ensuring proper alignment and layout.

### 3. Hyperlinks and Contact Form:

- Create **hyperlinks**:
  - Link to your **email** (using `mailto:`) and **phone number** (using `tel:`).
- In the **contact section**, include:
  - A form with input fields for the user's name, email, and a message.
  - A submit button (this doesn't need to be functional but should be styled).

### 4. Images:

- Add a **picture of yourself** in the "About" section.
- Include **at least two images** in the "Projects" section representing work you've done or fictional projects.

### 5. Deployment on GitHub Pages:

- Push your code to a **GitHub repository**.
- Deploy your portfolio page using **GitHub Pages** to make it live online.
  - Share the link to your GitHub Pages site as part of the submission.
